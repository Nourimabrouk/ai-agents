```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Basic Training Demo

Run a complete training demo with curriculum learning:

```bash
# Trading environment with 4 agents for 2000 episodes
python rl_training_demo.py --demo_type trading --num_agents 4 --episodes 2000

# Supply chain environment
python rl_training_demo.py --demo_type supply_chain --num_agents 6 --episodes 3000

```

### 2. Custom Training Pipeline

```python
import asyncio
from rl.training.training_pipeline import create_trading_pipeline

# Create training pipeline
pipeline = create_trading_pipeline(
    num_agents=4,
    total_episodes=10000,
    use_curriculum=True,
    experiment_name="my_trading_experiment"
)

# Run training
results = asyncio.run(pipeline.train())
print(f"Best performance: {results['best_eval_score']:.3f}")
```

### 3. Environment Usage

```python
from rl.environments.trading_environment import TradingEnvironment
from rl.environments.base_environment import AgentConfig, AgentRole

# Create agent configurations
agent_configs = [
    AgentConfig(agent_id=f"trader_{i}", role=AgentRole.EXECUTOR, initial_balance=100000)
    for i in range(4)
]

# Create environment
env = TradingEnvironment(
    agent_configs=agent_configs,
    symbols=['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA', 'MSFT'],
    max_steps=1000
)

# Training loop
observations, info = env.reset()
for step in range(1000):
    actions = {agent_id: env.action_space.sample() for agent_id in observations.keys()}
    observations, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
    
    if all(terminated.values()):
        break
```

### 4. PPO Agent Usage

```python
from rl.algorithms.ppo_agent import PPOAgent, PPOConfig

# Create PPO configuration
config = PPOConfig(
    hidden_dims=[256, 256],
    learning_rate=3e-4,
    batch_size=256,
    ppo_epochs=4,
    epsilon_clip=0.2
)

# Create agent
agent = PPOAgent(
    agent_id="trading_agent",
    state_dim=64,  # Environment observation dimension
    action_dim=12,  # Environment action dimension
    config=config
)

# Training loop
for episode in range(1000):
    state, _ = env.reset()
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        # Select action with additional info for PPO
        action, info = agent.select_action_with_info(state)
        
        next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, env_info = env.step(action)
        done = terminated or truncated
        
        # Store experience
        agent.store_experience(state, action, reward, done, info)
        
        state = next_state
    
    # Update agent every episode
    if agent.should_update():
        metrics = agent.update()
        print(f"Episode {episode}: {metrics}")
```
