# ðŸ”¬ AI Agent Experiments

This directory contains all experimental work, prototypes, and research explorations.

## Directory Structure

```
experiments/
â”œâ”€â”€ demos/           # Working examples and showcases
â”œâ”€â”€ prototypes/      # Experimental agent implementations  
â”œâ”€â”€ research/        # Cutting-edge AI agent research
â””â”€â”€ sandbox/         # Quick tests and iterations
```

## Getting Started

### Run a Demo
```bash
cd experiments/demos/
python demo.py
```

### Create a New Experiment
```bash
cd experiments/sandbox/
# Create your experimental script here
```

## Experimental Philosophy

- **ðŸš€ Move Fast**: Sandbox for rapid iteration
- **ðŸ”¬ Research-Driven**: Explore cutting-edge techniques  
- **ðŸ“Š Data-Informed**: Measure what matters
- **ðŸ”„ Iterate Quickly**: Fail fast, learn faster
- **ðŸŽ¯ Focus on Discovery**: Not production-ready code

## From Experiment to Production

1. **Sandbox** â†’ Test ideas quickly
2. **Prototypes** â†’ Build working versions
3. **Demos** â†’ Create shareable examples
4. **Agents** â†’ Move to `agents/` directory
5. **Core** â†’ Integrate into core system
