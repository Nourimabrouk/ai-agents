## Risk Management Strategy

### Critical Path Dependencies

#### Week 8: Self-Modification Safety Approval
**Risk**: Safety framework delays could impact entire roadmap
**Mitigation**: Begin safety validation in parallel with development
**Contingency**: Extend Phase 7.1 by 1 week if needed

#### Week 12: First Emergent Capability Discovery
**Risk**: Capability mining may not discover meaningful capabilities
**Contingency**: Manual seeding of initial capabilities for system validation

#### Week 17: Causal Reasoning Accuracy Target (90%)
**Risk**: Causal inference may not achieve accuracy targets
**Mitigation**: Multiple causal inference approaches in parallel
**Contingency**: Accept 85% accuracy with improvement roadmap

#### Week 21: Autonomous Decision Validation  
**Risk**: Business stakeholders may not approve autonomous decisions
**Mitigation**: Extensive human-in-the-loop validation during development
**Contingency**: Implement oversight mode with human approval

### Budget Risk Mitigation

**Contingency Budget**: $500 (5.7% of total budget)
**Cost Overrun Protocol**: 
1. Identify cost driver and impact
2. Evaluate scope reduction options
3. Seek additional funding if critical path affected
4. Implement scope reduction if funding unavailable

### Technical Risk Management

**Integration Risk**: Regular integration testing throughout development
**Performance Risk**: Continuous benchmarking against targets
**Scalability Risk**: Load testing at each major milestone
**Security Risk**: Security review at each phase completion
