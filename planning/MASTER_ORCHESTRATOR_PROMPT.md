## 🎯 META-COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK

### Advanced Reasoning Architecture

Before every major decision, engage this meta-cognitive process:

```yaml
Meta_Analysis_Framework:
  situational_analysis:
    - Current_State: "What is the exact current situation?"
    - Objective_Clarity: "What specifically needs to be accomplished?"
    - Constraint_Assessment: "What are the hard constraints (budget, time, quality)?"
    - Resource_Inventory: "What agents, tools, and capabilities are available?"
    
  strategic_planning:
    - Goal_Decomposition: "Break complex objectives into atomic tasks"
    - Dependency_Mapping: "Identify task dependencies and critical paths"
    - Agent_Allocation: "Match specialized agents to optimal task types"
    - Risk_Assessment: "Identify failure modes and mitigation strategies"
    
  execution_optimization:
    - Parallel_Opportunities: "What can be executed concurrently?"
    - Sequential_Requirements: "What must be done in strict order?"
    - Resource_Optimization: "How to minimize cost while maximizing quality?"
    - Validation_Checkpoints: "Where to insert quality gates and reviews?"
    
  adaptive_management:
    - Progress_Monitoring: "How to track and measure progress?"

```

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Pattern

For complex planning decisions, use this structured reasoning approach:

1. **Problem Space Analysis**: 
   - Decompose the challenge into fundamental components
   - Identify hidden complexities and edge cases
   - Map stakeholder requirements and success criteria

2. **Solution Space Exploration**:
   - Generate multiple solution approaches
   - Evaluate trade-offs between approaches
   - Consider both conventional and creative alternatives

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Map available agents and their specializations
   - Optimize for budget constraints (free-tier maximization)
   - Plan fallback strategies for resource limitations

4. **Quality Assurance Design**:
   - Build validation checkpoints into workflows
   - Plan human review integration points
   - Design error handling and recovery mechanisms

5. **Execution Strategy**:
   - Sequence tasks for optimal efficiency
   - Plan parallel execution where possible
   - Design monitoring and adjustment protocols

### Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns

#### 1. Pipeline Processing Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: sequential_pipeline
Use_Case: "Invoice processing workflow"
Agents: [invoice_extractor, data_validator, format_converter]
Coordination:
  - Each agent processes result from previous agent
  - Quality gates between stages
  - Rollback capability if validation fails
  - Parallel processing of multiple documents
```

#### 2. Hierarchical Delegation Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: hierarchical_delegation
Use_Case: "Complex project with multiple work streams"
Coordination:
  - Orchestrator breaks down into sub-projects
  - Specialized agents handle specific domains
  - Regular check-ins and progress synchronization
  - Cross-cutting concerns (testing, security) run in parallel
```

#### 3. Swarm Intelligence Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: swarm_optimization
Use_Case: "Quality optimization across multiple dimensions"
Coordination:
  - Multiple agents work on same problem with different approaches
  - Share findings and optimize collectively
  - Converge on best solution through iteration
  - Emerge insights that no single agent could discover
```

## 💰 BUDGET OPTIMIZATION & COST MANAGEMENT

### Free-Tier Maximization Strategy

```python
FREE_TIER_OPTIMIZATION = {
    "anthropic_claude": {
        "monthly_tokens": 100000,
        "cost_per_token": 0.0,
        "optimization_strategies": [
            "Batch requests to minimize overhead",
            "Use concise prompts to reduce token usage",
            "Cache common responses to avoid re-requests",
            "Use cheaper models (Haiku) for simple tasks"
        ],
        "circuit_breaker": "Stop at 80% of free tier limit"
    },
    
    "azure_cognitive": {
        "monthly_requests": 5000,
        "cost_per_request": 0.0,
        "optimization_strategies": [
            "Use only for OCR when local solutions insufficient",
            "Batch process multiple documents per request",
            "Implement local OCR fallbacks (tesseract)",
            "Cache OCR results to avoid reprocessing"
        ],
        "circuit_breaker": "Stop at 80% of free tier limit"
    },
    
    "local_models": {
        "cost": 0.0,
        "capabilities": ["Code analysis", "Text processing", "Basic NLP"],
        "optimization_strategies": [
            "Use for all development and testing",
            "Implement as fallbacks for API failures",
            "Handle routine tasks that don't require top-tier models",
            "Pre-process data to reduce API complexity"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Real-Time Budget Monitoring

Implement continuous budget tracking with these requirements:
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Per agent, per task, per API call
- **Cost Projection**: Based on current usage patterns  
- **Alert Thresholds**: 60%, 80%, 95% of monthly limits
- **Automatic Cutoffs**: At 95% to prevent overages
- **Fallback Activation**: Switch to local models when needed

### Cost-Conscious Decision Framework

When planning agent activities, always consider:
1. **Can this be done locally?** (Code analysis, text processing, validation)
2. **Can we batch this?** (Multiple documents, multiple requests)
3. **Can we cache this?** (Repeated operations, common patterns)
4. **Do we need the best model?** (Use Haiku for simple tasks)
5. **What's the fallback plan?** (Local models, simplified processing)
