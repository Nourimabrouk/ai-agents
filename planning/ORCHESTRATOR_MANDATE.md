- **Emergency Stop**: Auto-halt at 90% monthly budget consumption
- **Free First**: Always exhaust free tiers before paid services

### **Cost Optimization Strategies**
```
PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Local Processing (FREE) - Use when possible
2. Free Tier APIs - OpenAI, Claude, Google credits
3. Cached Results - Never repeat identical requests
4. Batch Processing - Optimize API call efficiency
5. Paid APIs - Only for high-value or critical tasks
```

### **Budget Monitoring Requirements**
- **Real-time Tracking**: Cost visibility per request
- **Daily Reports**: Spending summary and projections
- **Weekly Reviews**: Budget performance and adjustments
- **Monthly Analysis**: ROI assessment and planning

## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**

### **Required Design Patterns**
1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Auto-disable expensive services when budget exceeded
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Local ‚Üí Free ‚Üí Paid service hierarchy
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis/SQLite for repeated request results
4. **Queue System**: Batch processing for efficiency
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics

### **Technology Stack Constraints**
- **Local Development**: Windows 11, Python 3.13, SQLite
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI APIs
- **Local LLM**: Ollama or similar lightweight solution
- **Web Interface**: FastAPI + simple HTML/JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: Local SQLite with backup strategies
