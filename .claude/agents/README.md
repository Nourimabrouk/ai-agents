## üöÄ How to Use These Agents

### Automatic Agent Selection
Claude Code will automatically spawn appropriate agents based on your requests:

```bash
# This will automatically spawn system-architect
"I need to design a REST API for user management with authentication"

# This will spawn backend-developer + test-automator
"Implement the user registration endpoint with comprehensive tests"

# This will spawn security-auditor + code-reviewer  
"Review this authentication code for security vulnerabilities"

# This will spawn performance-optimizer + database-designer
"My queries are slow, help optimize the database performance"
```

### Manual Agent Invocation
You can explicitly request specific agents:

```bash
"Use the system-architect agent to design a microservices architecture"
"Have the security-auditor agent scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities" 
"Ask the performance-optimizer agent to analyze these slow endpoints"
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
Agents are designed to work together in coordinated workflows:

```bash
"Build a complete user authentication system"
# ‚Üí system-architect (design) ‚Üí backend-developer (implement) ‚Üí 
#   test-automator (test) ‚Üí security-auditor (audit) ‚Üí code-reviewer (review)
```

## üìÅ Agent File Structure

```
.claude/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system-architect.md       # System design & architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-developer.md      # Server-side implementation  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-automator.md         # Comprehensive testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-reviewer.md          # Quality & security review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database-designer.md      # Data architecture & optimization

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance-optimizer.md  # Performance optimization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This documentation
```

Each agent file follows the Claude Code standard format:
```yaml

name: agent-name
description: When this agent should be invoked (with trigger keywords)
tools: List, of, tools, agent, can, use
---

Detailed agent prompt and capabilities...
```

## üîß Agent Capabilities & Tools

### Tool Access Patterns
- **system-architect**: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash (design artifacts)
- **backend-developer**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, TodoWrite (full development)
- **test-automator**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep (comprehensive testing)
- **code-reviewer**: Read, Grep, Glob, Edit (analysis and review)

- **security-auditor**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit (security scanning)
- **performance-optimizer**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, MultiEdit (optimization)

### Coordination Patterns
Agents are designed with built-in coordination protocols:

1. **Sequential Workflows**: Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Review
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Multiple agents analyze the same code simultaneously  
3. **Handoff Protocols**: Agents provide context to subsequent agents
4. **Dependency Management**: Agents specify when other agents should be involved

## üéØ Real-World Usage Examples

### Complete API Development Workflow
```bash
User: "Build a REST API for task management with authentication, testing, and deployment"

# Automatic agent coordination:
# 1. system-architect: Designs API architecture and database schema
# 2. backend-developer: Implements FastAPI endpoints and models
# 3. test-automator: Creates comprehensive test suites  
# 4. security-auditor: Reviews for security vulnerabilities
# 5. performance-optimizer: Optimizes query performance
# 6. code-reviewer: Final quality review and recommendations
```

### Security-Focused Review
```bash  
User: "Audit this authentication system for security issues"

# Spawns: security-auditor + code-reviewer
# - Comprehensive OWASP Top 10 analysis
# - Code quality and best practices review
# - Specific vulnerability identification and fixes
# - Compliance checking (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
```

### Performance Optimization Project
```bash
User: "My application is slow, help me optimize it"

# Spawns: performance-optimizer + database-designer + code-reviewer
# - Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
# - Database query optimization and indexing
# - Caching strategy implementation
# - Code review for optimization opportunities
```

## üîÑ Agent Communication Patterns

### Context Sharing
Agents share context through structured handoffs:

```yaml
# system-architect provides to backend-developer:
technical_specifications:
  - API endpoint definitions
  - Database schema requirements
  - Authentication requirements
  - Performance targets

# backend-developer provides to test-automator:  
implementation_context:
  - Endpoint implementations
  - Database models
  - Error handling patterns
  - Business logic flows
```

### Parallel Coordination
Multiple agents can work on the same codebase simultaneously:

```bash
# Parallel analysis workflow:
User: "Review this codebase for production readiness"

# Spawns simultaneously:
# - code-reviewer (quality analysis)
# - security-auditor (security analysis)  
# - performance-optimizer (performance analysis)
# - test-automator (test coverage analysis)

# Results are combined into comprehensive assessment
```

## üìä Agent Performance & Monitoring

### Quality Metrics
Each agent is designed for measurable outcomes:

- **system-architect**: Architecture quality score, design completeness
- **backend-developer**: Code coverage, implementation completeness, error handling
- **test-automator**: Test coverage (>90%), performance benchmarks
- **code-reviewer**: Issue detection rate, false positive rate
- **database-designer**: Query performance improvements, schema optimization
- **security-auditor**: Vulnerability detection, compliance coverage
- **performance-optimizer**: Performance improvement metrics, optimization success rate

### Continuous Improvement
Agents learn and improve through:
- Pattern recognition from successful projects
- Feedback incorporation from code reviews
- Performance metric tracking and optimization
- Best practice evolution and updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Extension

### Adding Custom Agents
Create new agents by following the template:

```yaml
---
name: your-custom-agent
description: When to invoke this agent with specific keywords
tools: Required, Tools, List
---

Your specialized agent prompt and capabilities...
```

### Modifying Existing Agents
- Update agent descriptions to change trigger patterns
- Modify tool access to expand or restrict capabilities  
- Enhance prompts with domain-specific knowledge
- Add new collaboration patterns with other agents

### Integration with Your Workflow
- **Git Integration**: Agents work with your existing Git workflow
- **CI/CD Integration**: Agent outputs integrate with GitHub Actions, etc.
- **IDE Integration**: Works seamlessly with VS Code, Cursor, etc.
- **Documentation**: Agents generate documentation that fits your standards

## üéâ Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **The agents are already installed** in your `.claude/agents/` directory
2. **Start using them immediately** - Claude Code will automatically select appropriate agents
3. **Try a test request**: "Design a simple REST API with authentication"
4. **Watch the magic happen** as agents coordinate and deliver results

### Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: More specific requests get better agent selection
2. **Use Keywords**: Include trigger words like "design", "implement", "test", "secure"
3. **Think Workflows**: Request complete features, not just individual tasks
4. **Review Results**: Always review agent outputs for your specific context
5. **Iterate**: Use agent feedback to refine and improve your requests

## üîó Integration Examples

### With Existing Projects
```bash
# Agents work with your existing codebase
"Review the security of our user authentication system"
"Optimize the performance of our dashboard queries" 
"Add comprehensive tests to our payment processing code"
```

### With Development Tools
```bash  
# Integrates with your existing toolchain
"Set up monitoring for our FastAPI application"
"Create deployment scripts for our Docker containers"
"Generate OpenAPI documentation for our API endpoints"
```

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Operation
- Agents understand your existing codebase structure
- Maintain consistency with your coding standards
- Respect your architectural decisions and patterns
- Work within your technology stack and constraints

### Parallel Processing
