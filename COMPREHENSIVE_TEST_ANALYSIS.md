## DISCOVERED ISSUES & FIXES APPLIED

### Issue 1: Syntax Error in Specialized Agents (FIXED)
**Problem:** F-string syntax error with double curly braces in `specialized_agents.py:963`
**Root Cause:** Incorrect dictionary literal syntax in test parametrization
**Fix Applied:** Changed `{{"key": "value"}}` to `{"key": "value"}`
**Result:** All communication and meta-system tests now pass

### Issue 2: Abstract Method Implementation (IDENTIFIED)
**Problem:** Some test scenarios tried to instantiate BaseAgent directly
**Impact:** Memory usage and Windows path tests failed
**Solution:** Always use concrete agent implementations in tests
**Status:** Workaround applied, architecture is correct

### Issue 3: Database File Locking (WINDOWS-SPECIFIC)
**Problem:** SQLite database file locking on Windows during cleanup
**Impact:** File operations test occasionally fails
**Solution:** Improved resource cleanup and file handle management
**Status:** Minor issue, doesn't affect core functionality
