## Horizontal Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: Single-Instance Optimization (0-1K docs/day)
**Target**: Handle 1,000 documents/day on single Windows machine

```yaml
Current Capacity Optimization:
  - Document Processing: 50-100 docs/hour per agent
  - Concurrent Agents: 5-10 agents simultaneously  
  - Memory Usage: <2GB RAM for document processing
  - CPU Utilization: 70-80% during peak processing

Immediate Improvements:
  - Connection Pooling: SQLite connection optimization
  - Async File I/O: Non-blocking document reading
  - Memory Streaming: Process large PDFs without loading entirely
  - Result Caching: Cache frequently accessed extraction patterns
```

**Implementation**:
```python
# Enhanced document processing with memory streaming
class OptimizedDocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_pool = await create_connection_pool(max_connections=20)
        self.memory_limit = 512 * 1024 * 1024  # 512MB per document
        self.result_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=3600)
    
    async def process_document_stream(self, file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process document with memory streaming and caching"""
        cache_key = f"{file_path}:{os.path.getmtime(file_path)}"
        
        if cache_key in self.result_cache:
            return self.result_cache[cache_key]
        
        # Stream processing to avoid memory spikes
        async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            result = await self.stream_process_chunks(f)
        
        self.result_cache[cache_key] = result
        return result
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Process Scaling (1K-10K docs/day)

```yaml
Process Architecture:
  - Master Process: Orchestration and coordination
  - Worker Processes: 4-8 document processing workers

        self.process_pool = ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers)
        self.task_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=100)
        self.result_cache = SharedCache()  # Windows shared memory
    
    async def scale_processing(self, documents: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Distribute document processing across multiple processes"""
        # Batch documents for optimal throughput
        batches = self._create_optimal_batches(documents)
        
        # Submit to process pool with load balancing
        futures = [
            self.process_pool.submit(self._process_batch, batch) 
            for batch in batches
        ]
        
        # Gather results with timeout handling
        results = await asyncio.gather(
            *[asyncio.wrap_future(f) for f in futures],
            return_exceptions=True
        )
        
        return self._merge_batch_results(results)
```

        self.shared_storage = NetworkStorage()
    
    async def distribute_processing(self, document_batch: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Distribute processing across specialized nodes"""
        
        # Classify documents and route to appropriate nodes
        classification_tasks = await self._classify_documents(document_batch)
        
        # Route to specialized nodes based on document type
        routing_plan = await self._create_routing_plan(classification_tasks)
        
        # Execute distributed processing
        distributed_results = await self._execute_distributed_plan(routing_plan)
        
        # Aggregate and validate results
        return await self._aggregate_distributed_results(distributed_results)
```

  - Database Size: Multi-terabyte databases supported
  - Concurrent Readers: Unlimited with WAL mode
```

**Implementation**:
```python
# Optimized SQLite configuration for high performance
class OptimizedSQLiteManager:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str):
        self.db_path = db_path
        self.connection_pool = None
    
    async def initialize(self):
        """Initialize SQLite with performance optimizations"""
        
        # Performance pragma settings
        performance_config = {
            'journal_mode': 'WAL',           # Write-Ahead Logging
            'synchronous': 'NORMAL',         # Balance safety and speed
            'cache_size': '-64000',          # 64MB cache
            'temp_store': 'MEMORY',          # Temp tables in memory
            'mmap_size': '1073741824',       # 1GB memory mapping
            'optimize': True                 # Automatic optimization
        }
        
        self.connection_pool = await self._create_optimized_pool(performance_config)
    
    async def batch_insert_documents(self, documents: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> None:
        """High-performance batch document insertion"""
        async with self.connection_pool.acquire() as conn:
            # Use batch transactions for maximum throughput
            async with conn.transaction():
                await conn.executemany(
                    "INSERT INTO documents VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                    [(d['id'], d['type'], d['content'], d['metadata']) for d in documents]
                )
```

### Hybrid Database Architecture (Scale-out Option)
```yaml

        agent_pool = self.agent_pools[task_type]
        available_agents = await agent_pool.get_available_agents()
        
        # Select based on performance history and current load
        optimal_agent = await self.load_balancer.select_agent(
