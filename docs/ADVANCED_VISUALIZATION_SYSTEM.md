2. **WebSocket Server** streams updates to connected clients
3. **Frontend State Management** processes incoming data
4. **Visualization Components** render updates with smooth transitions
5. **Performance Monitoring** tracks rendering performance and optimizes

### Performance Optimizations

**Rendering Optimizations**
- Three.js object pooling for dynamic elements
- Level-of-detail (LOD) systems for complex scenes
- Frustum culling for off-screen objects
- Instanced rendering for similar objects
- Selective re-rendering based on change detection

**Data Processing**
- Web Workers for heavy computations
- Incremental data updates instead of full refreshes
- Compression for WebSocket messages
- Client-side caching with intelligent invalidation

**Memory Management**
- Automatic cleanup of unused Three.js objects
- Circular buffer for historical data
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Resource preloading for smooth transitions
