from core.reasoning.causal_inference import CausalReasoningEngine
engine = CausalReasoningEngine()
result = await engine.discover_causal_relationships()  # SLOW!

```

### Working Memory System Optimization
```python
# Apply performance decorators to existing functions
from core.performance import cached, async_optimized, profile_memory

@cached(ttl=1800, key_prefix="memory_")
@async_optimized(max_concurrent=50)
@profile_memory("memory_consolidation")
async def optimized_memory_consolidation(memories):
    # Your existing memory consolidation logic
    pass
```

### Self-Modification Engine Optimization
```python
# Parallel code validation with caching
from core.performance import AsyncOptimizer, cached

optimizer = AsyncOptimizer()

@cached(ttl=7200, key_prefix="codegen_")
async def cached_code_generation(specification):
    return await generate_code(specification)

# Parallel validation

async def create_optimized_component():
    # Get the global optimizer
    optimizer = await get_optimizer()
    
    # Use optimization features
    result = await optimizer.async_optimizer.execute_with_concurrency_limit(
        your_coroutine(), "task_id"

    # Check performance
    score = await optimizer.get_current_performance_score()
    print(f"Current performance: {score}/100")
```
